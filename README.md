# krstatic-comp2.2

This has been a fun project. I attempted to to first match the comp before getting too creative. My focus was attention to
detail and doing my best to make sure my version looked as clean as possible. Once I felt like I was in a good spot I started 
playing with color combonations. I used a lot of media queries and would like to refactor at some point using less. I can
definitely find places to improve but am happy with the excecution so far.
